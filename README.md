# Metal-Detector-Circuit-using-Arduino


1. The Arduino generates a series of pulses on which are sent to the coil. These pulses create a magnetic field around the coil.
2. When a metal object is brought near the coil, the inductance of the coil changes. This change affects the resonant frequency of the LC circuit formed by the coil and the capacitor.
3. The oscillating signal generated by the LC circuit is rectified by the diode. The resulting DC signal is stored in the capacitor.
4. The Arduino reads the voltage across the capacitor through the analog input pin. This voltage is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil.
5. The buzzer and led are visual and auditory indication for when metal is detected.
